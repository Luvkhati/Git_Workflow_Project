# Git Workflow Project 💼

This project is a hands-on simulation of real-world Git collaboration and version control using Jupyter notebooks. It demonstrates clean branching, merging, stash, conflict resolution, and GitHub workflows — all skills used in actual software and data engineering teams.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Git / GitHub
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Python (Pandas)
- VS Code / Terminal

## 📁 Project Structure & Branches

| Branch         | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `master`       | Final production-ready pipeline                  |
| `branch_A`     | Loads first dataset (`breast_cancer_data.csv`)   |
| `branch_B`     | Loads second dataset (`breast_cancer_data1.csv`) |
| `data_cleaning`| Simulates basic data cleaning logic              |
| `conflict1`    | Created merge conflict for demo purposes         |
| `merge_branch` | Merged datasets A and B into one file            |
